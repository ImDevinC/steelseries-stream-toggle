# steelseries-stream-toggle

This is a simple application that when ran, will toggle the current SteelSeries Sonar mode between Stream and Classic.

Much of the underlying work was done by https://github.com/wex/sonar-rev and https://github.com/adirh3/Sonar.AutoSwitch/tree/master, so be sure to check out their projects for more details.

## How to use
Simply download the latest release and put it somewhere on your computer. Then you can run the application to toggle the mode. I activate mine with my StreamDeck.
